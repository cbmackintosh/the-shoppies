## Abstract:

This project was submitted as part of my application to Shopify's Fall 2021 Frontend Developer Internship. It's a simple React application that consumes the <a href="http://omdbapi.com/">OMDb API</a>, allowing users to search from a database of movies by title. Users can chose to nominate a movie from the search results panel on the left side of the screen, which then adds that movie title to a list of nominations on the right side of the screen. Nominated movies can then be un-nominated using the 'Remove' button. Once the user has nominated five movies, a notification banner appears at the top of the screen.
